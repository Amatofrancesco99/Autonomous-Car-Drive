# Detecting cars & pedestrians

This section contains new software (python) whose aim is to add one (control of both other cars both pedestrians control) of the new features that an autonomous car should have (maybe with one solution more accurate than the one that I've developed).  

There are so many features that can be added to this project, for example driver's eye-tracking, line crossing and so on... 

***

This software implements a *Cascade Classifier* , more specifically the **Haar Classifier for Object Detection**.
If you're interested on seeing how this Classifier works, just because I am lazy, see the description (README.md) of another project, always developed by me...here's the link:
