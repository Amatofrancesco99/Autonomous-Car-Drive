# Autonomous-Car-Drive

This repository is related to an autonomous car drive project. 
The car is avoiding obstacles through an optical sensor (this code was projected to work on a "model machine", not a real one)

*FOLDERS' CONTENTS DESCRIPTION :*
- **Folder "Thesis"** ==> you can find a .docx file which contains my upper secondary school thesis ( it has been wrote in Italian);
- **Folder "Script & Images/Images"** ==> you can find both images ( of the skeleton & real car model ), both videos ( to proof that all the scripts are successfully working ).
- **Folder "Script & Images/... ( except from Images )"** ==> you can find both complete script ( *.ino, wrote with Arduino* ) to control all the parts of the car, both the control of each singolar part of the car model ( more specifically the control of: servo accelerometers, optical sensor );
